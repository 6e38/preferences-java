# Preferences
*library for java*

Java has a built-in preferences class and I really wanted to use it, but for some reason they don't create the appropriate registry key for Windows thus making it useless. Much sadness.

This library comes with no warranty. Use at your own risk.

You may use and/or modify this code.

## Known Issues
* Depends on a super lite json library

## Usage

`ant compile` builds the project

`ant test` runs some tests on the code

`ant jar` packages the project

## Todo
* Fix json to use OutputStream or something
